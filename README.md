# Lithium-Ion-Battery-Prognostics-through-Reinforcement-Learning
Lithium-ion is a progressive battery technology that has been used in vastly different electrical systems. Failure of the battery can lead to failure in the entire system where the battery is embedded and cause irreversible damage. To avoid probable damages, research is actively conducted, and data-driven methods are proposed, based on prognostics and health management (PHM) systems. PHM can use multiple time-scale data and stored information from battery capacities over several cycles to determine the battery state of health (SOH) and its remaining useful life (RUL). This results in battery safety, stability, reliability, and longer lifetime.

This is the official implementation of the paper https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/15/11/393 , in which we have proposed different data-driven approaches to battery prognostics (LSTM, ARIMA, and Reinforcement Learning) based on the permutation entropy of battery voltage sequences at each cycle, since they take into account vital information from past data and result in high accuracy.
